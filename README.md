# Advanced-Python-Course

This repository contains excercises and tasks I did attending the Advanced Python Course in University of Wroclaw

I've also completed various bigger personal projects during this course:

 - [**Web Crawler**](https://github.com/kornelorawczak/Web-Crawl)
 - [**Conway's Game Of Life**](https://github.com/kornelorawczak/Conways-Game-Of-Life)
 - [**Price Charts**](https://github.com/kornelorawczak/Price-Charts)
 - [**Weather and film API explorer**](https://github.com/kornelorawczak/API-Weather-IMDB)
 - [**Optimal Sudoku Solver**](https://github.com/kornelorawczak/Sudoku-Solver)

The final project was much broaded and bigger in scale, done in Django - see the project [here](https://github.com/kornelorawczak/Final-Django-Project)
